# Spreaditor

This is a 2D Collider Editor for Sprites developed by Rubén Osorio López.

The purpose of this project is helping developers of sprite-based games deal with the workflow of defining rectangular colliders, also sometimes referred to as HitBoxes, in an easy, fast and robust way while avoiding the traditional and tedious process of going through every frame by hand and calculating the size and position of every rectangle which is also very error-prone and susceptible to mistakes.
