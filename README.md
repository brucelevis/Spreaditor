# Spreaditor

This is a 2D Collider Editor for Sprites developed by Rubén Osorio López.

The purpose of this project is helping developers of sprite-based games deal with the workflow of defining rectangular colliders, also sometimes referred to as HitBoxes, in an easy, fast and robust way while avoiding the traditional and tedious process of going through every frame by hand and calculating the size and position of every rectangle which is also very error-prone and susceptible to mistakes.

## What is coming!

I am **currently in the phase of testing** the project to find out if there are any significant bugs that might hurt the utility this tool provides. I will also **release a video** pointing out the main features and how to use them to avoid having to look into some long manual or documentation which, for a project as concrete as this one, should not be required.

For the time being here you have two links used for the testing phase of this software, one dedicated to **collider creation** and the other to **collider testing**:
