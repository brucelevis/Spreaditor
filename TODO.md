# TODO

* Check the sizes of the **not yet** scaled buttons such as the accept and cancel ones.
* Create ActionManager where I can register the last few actions that happened with a function that reverts its changes that can be called on "Undo".
* Move the "delete" buttons in the hierarchy to the header bar of the element itself, likea little thrash bin button on the colored header.
